# Housing Prices


## Introduction
In project 3 for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program we were tasked with taking on the role of a consultant for a real estate firm located in Ames, Iowa. Our goal was to build a regression model to predict predict prices. We also tried to to give some insight into which areas had the highest sales prices and highest sales volume.

## The Data
The dataset set was taken as a subset from Kaggle.com. We selected 19 features from the total 82 feature data set:
