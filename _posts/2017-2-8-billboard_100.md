# Billboard 100 (2000)

## Introduction
In this second project for General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program I investigated the music of the 2000s. Specifically, I analyzed songs from the Billboard Hot 100 which peaked in the year 2000. My goal was to perform exploratory data analysis in order to better understand what makes a particular song reach the top of the charts.

## The Data
The dataset is taken from Billboard.com and provides a complete list of songs that peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 in the year 2000. Attributes of the dataset include Artist Name, Track Name, Song Length, Genre, Date Entered, Date Peaked, and a column for each week with a corresponding ranking. See data dictionary below:
